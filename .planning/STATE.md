# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-09)

**Core value:** The knowledge layer must reliably ingest, categorize, store, and retrieve information from diverse sources — so that every piece of content GhostWriter produces is backed by a deep, growing intelligence.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Vector DB Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Vector DB Foundation)
Plan: 1 of 4 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-10 — Completed 01-01-PLAN.md (Docker + pgvector + schema)

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] ~5%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 3 min
- Total execution time: 0.05 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 - Vector DB Foundation | 1 | 3 min | 3 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: [01-01: 3 min]
- Trend: First plan completed

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Knowledge layer before output formats: Build the engine first, then applications around it — richer knowledge makes every output better
- pgvector + OpenAI embeddings: Research recommends PostgreSQL with pgvector over managed vector DBs for cost efficiency and Python integration
- Modular RAG with tool-based retrieval: RAG operates as LangGraph tools invoked by agents, not as separate service layer coupling to hot path
- Daily batch for Gmail ingestion: Simpler than real-time, sufficient for newsletter use case
- Both structured extraction + semantic chunks: Structured for precise facts, chunks for broad retrieval — covers both use cases

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Critical integration risks identified in research:**
- Breaking existing pipeline with poorly integrated RAG (prevention: feature flags per agent, async retrieval with timeout, circuit breaker)
- Hallucination amplification from bad chunking/retrieval (prevention: semantic chunking from day one, reranking with cross-encoder, metadata filtering)
- Gmail API quota exhaustion (prevention: batch API, exponential backoff, proactive token refresh)
- Semantic Scholar rate limits (prevention: batch endpoints, 1 req/sec enforcement, citation depth limiting)

**Phase-specific research flags:**
- Phase 3 (Gmail Ingestion): Newsletter format diversity testing needed with Substack/Beehiiv/ConvertKit
- Phase 4 (Semantic Scholar): Citation graph traversal strategies and batch endpoint behavior need validation
- Phase 5 (Pipeline Integration): Agent-specific retrieval impact unknown — A/B testing required
