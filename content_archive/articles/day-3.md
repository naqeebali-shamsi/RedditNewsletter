# Day 3: Goal Decomposition — Breaking the Unbreakable

![Goal Decomposition: From Business Goal to Agent Task](assets/day-3.png)

**Business goals are fuzzy. Technical tasks are binary. The most valuable skill in Agentic AI is learning how to bridge that gap.**

When a stakeholder says "Automate our customer feedback analysis," an agent will fail if you pass that string directly. I’ve seen agents stall for hours because they were overwhelmed by the scope. 

The secret? **Recursive Decomposition.**

## The Art of the Atomic Task

1. **Identify the Core Logic**
   Every massive goal is just a collection of small logic gates. Decomposition is the process of stripping away the "Vibes" and identifying the "Mechanics." 

2. **The "Definition of Done" (DoD) for Agents**
   If an agent doesn't know what "Finished" looks like, it will keep iterating (and burning tokens). You must decompose the goal until every task has a binary success state (e.g., "File exists" or "Database row updated").

3. **Defining the Scope Boundary**
   "Small" isn't enough; it must be "Isolated." A well-decomposed task should not depend on the outcome of the next task. This prevents "Logical Cascades" where one failure kills the entire system.

4. **The Hierarchical Approach**
   Start with the Meta-Goal, break it into 3 Workstreams, and break those into 5 Tasks each. This hierarchy is the only way to manage "Agentic Drift" in long-running processes.

## The Vision

By mastering decomposition, you stop building "Chatbots" and start building **Autonomous Pipelines.** You move from being an "AI User" to being an **AI Architect.**
