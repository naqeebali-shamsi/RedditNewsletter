# Day 7: Week 1 Recap — Mapping the Cognitive Landscape

![Cognitive Architecture: The Week 1 Recap](assets/day-7.png)

**Technological progress usually happens in "Vibes," but mastery happens in "Patterns."**

We just finished Week 1 of our 30-day journey. We moved from the "Why" (Manifesto) through the core building blocks of agentic reasoning (ReAct, Planning, Tool Use, and Fallbacks). 

If you take only one thing away from this week, let it be this: **The Agent is not the Model. The Agent is the Architecture.**

## The Week 1 Technical Summary

- **Day 1: ReAct Patterns**: Reasoning + Acting isn't a suggestion; it's the runtime for autonomy.
- **Day 2: Plan-and-Execute**: Decoupling the "Architect" (Planner) from the "Worker" (Executor).
- **Day 3: Goal Decomposition**: Breaking fuzzy business goals into binary task logic.
- **Day 4: Tool-Using Agents**: Giving the brain hands through structured, schema-bound toolsets.
- **Day 5: Prompting for Logic**: Moving from "Prose" to "Policies" using structured tags and DoD patterns.
- **Day 6: Fallback Mechanisms**: Designing systems that expect failure and handle it gracefully via HITL.

## The Vision for Week 2

Next week, we go deeper. We move from "How they think" (Cognitive Architecture) to "How they remember" (**Persistence & Memory**). 

We’ll explore Vector DBs, Context Retention, and how to prevent your agents from "forgetting" everything the moment a session ends.

**Day 7 of 30: Week 1 complete. Architecture locked.**

**The Journey:** Which concept from Week 1 was the "Aha!" moment for you? What do you want to see us build in Week 2? 👇
