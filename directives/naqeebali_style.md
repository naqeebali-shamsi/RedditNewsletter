# Naqeebali’s Writing Style Guide (Agency Version)

## 0. Who I Am & What I’m Optimizing For

- **Audience:** Mid–Senior Engineers, Tech Leads, AI Engineers.
- **Positioning Goal:** BUt known as an **Expert Pragmatist** in AI engineering (production LLMs, Claude workflows, tech debt).
- **Voice:** Authentic, vulnerable, direct ("I built", "I broke").

## 1. The Golden Rules (Non‑Negotiable)

1. **Aggressive Hooks**: Never open with "This article is about...". Use **Curiosity Gaps**, **Provocative Questions**, or **Bold Claims**.
   - *Example (Curiosity Gap)*: "The LLM hack that cut our token costs 70%—without fine-tuning."
   - *Example (Provocative Question)*: "Is your RAG setup leaking context? 3 symptoms you're ignoring."

2. **Subtle Storytelling**: Weave in short, relatable anecdotes (2-4 sentences) at starts/transitions.
   - *The Hero's Journey*: "2 AM, pager explodes—our RAG pipeline just choked on 10GB docs. Here's the fix."
   - *Emotional Pull*: Limit to 10-15% of word count. Keep it 80% technical.

3. **High Takeaway Density**: Every section must answer "What should I do?".
   - Use bold lists and "The Rule:" callouts.

4. **Humor & Wordplay**: Dose sparingly (Exactly 1-2 per post). 
   - *Target*: Tech puns ("Import ant"), analogies ("APIs are like restaurant menus"), or dry self-deprecating quips.
   - *Tone*: Avoid sarcasm; simple humor helps fight technical monotony.

5. **Ethical "Value-Bait" Titles**: Use numbers, contradictions, or secrets.
   - *Formula*: [Number] + [Pain/Trend] + [Contrarian Promise].
   - *Good*: "7 RAG Mistakes Killing Your LLM (And Fixes That Work)".

## 2. Structure & Formatting

**The Opening (First 10-12 lines)**
1. **Hook** (Curiosity gap or bold claim).
2. **The Scene** (Short anecdote, personal struggle).
3. **The Pivot** ("You're not alone").
4. **TL;DR** (Bullet summary).

... (rest of structure remains same)

## 5. Forbidden Patterns

- ❌ Passive voice ("Mistakes were made").
- ❌ Academic intros ("In today's fast-paced world...").
- ❌ Walls of text (>4 lines).
- ❌ Generic advice (If ChatGPT could write it, cut it).
- ❌ Sensationalist Clickbait ("You won't believe..."). Cut the clickbait if it lacks specific value.
